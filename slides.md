## Stolen Goods

Bought laptop after it was returned to friend

Notes:

- Excuse typos
  - MIT story of Ramesh's signatue
- Tell story of how I got laptop

---

## Objectives

- Appreciate SPI buses
- Improve understanding of Apple design
- Troubleshoot hardware

---

## HW or SW

Notes:

GPS that we thouht was sw for sure

---

1. Read
2. Find Possible Causes
3. Rank by Impact
4. Backup
5. Attempt to Fix

---

## Simple -> Complex

1. Reboot
2. Update
3. SMC
4. PRAM/NVRAM
5. Disk Encryption
6. Re-install macOS

Notes:

- Apple eco system and system arch
- Tell you that so I can tell you this

---

## System Layers üç∞

Notes:

- Layers
- Understand arch to debug

- [Hardware microphone disconnect](https://www.apple.com/mideast/mac/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf)
  - Mac portables with T2
  - hardware disconnect
  - disabled whenever the lid is closed
  - implemented in hardware alone
  - prevents even T2
  - camera is not disconnected since completely obstructed when closed

System Management Controller ([SMC]((https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295)))
manages power

Notes:

- **Important later because of batter issues**
- Battery isn't charging
- Mac isn't turning on
- Fans are running fast
- Mac laptop computer gets too warm
- Built-in camera isn't working

Notes:

- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFi)

---

## Where Does That Leave Me?

| Level | Status |
| -- | -- | 
| UEFI | ‚úÖ |
| macOS | ‚ùå |

Notes:

- Back to HW or SW

---

## We interrupt this broadcast...

What's the cost?

‚åõÔ∏è üí∞ üìâ üìö

Notes:

- time, money, and future productivity
- not receiving macOS upgrades

---

## Back to the Inter-webs

---

## Trackpad Cable

<img class="r-stretch" src="images/trackpad-cable.jpeg">

Notes:

- Risk selection
- Low cost

---

## More Studying

## 2 Insights

- SPI & USB
- Corrosion

---

Remember, it was stolen

---

1. Can I fix it?
2. Can I understand it?

---

Why SPI?

Notes:

- Thought I was suppose to be finding answers

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="images/spi.png">

---

## Why SPI

- Speed/bandwidth
- Power
- Simple

---

## What's Next

---

- Appreciate SPI buses
  - SPI makes Mac trackpads awesome
- Improve understanding of Apple design
  - Integratin of hardware and software drives performance
- Troubleshoot hardware
  - Hardware or Software
